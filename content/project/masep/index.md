Marine Robotics Research with MASEP Our lab is advancing underwater robotic systems through the development of MASEP (Miniature Autonomous Submersible Experiment Platform), a tabletop-sized research platform designed for controlled experimentation with miniature Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs).

<!--more-->

Key Features of MASEP:

* Four Degrees of Freedom (DOF): Each AUV can move in multiple directions, with passive stabilization provided by internal ballast and buoyancy.

* Vision-Based Localization: A camera tracks the AUVs within the tank, simulating GPS-like localization for underwater environments.

* Real-Time Communication: The system allows seamless data exchange and control between the AUVs and a central server.

MASEP provides a flexible and cost-effective platform for testing robotic navigation, communication, and control strategies, accelerating the development of technologies for real-world underwater applications.

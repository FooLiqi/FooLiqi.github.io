Embodied Intelligence, or Embodied AI, emphasizes the role of physical embodiment in cognitive processes, suggesting that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent's body, environment, and cognitive systems. Our lab explores this concept to develop more adaptable and effective AI systems for real-world applications.

Traditional robot manipulation is primarily based on a single robot arm with a parallel gripper. In specific scenarios, a single robot arm may not operate with optimal intelligence and efficiency. Dual arm collaborative manipulation can enhance the success rate of task execution by mirroring human manipulation in form and logic. Moreover, the quality of grasping is heavily reliant on the effectiveness and adaptability of the grasping tool. Therefore, we aim to investigate the feasibility of developing a dependable and scalable grasping tool. By employing embodied AI strategies, these manipulation techniques can be effectively integrated into both industrial and everyday settings.
